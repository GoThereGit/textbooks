### Five Key Features

Driven by the digital wave, digital humanities,an emerging interdisciplinary field that combines humanities with computing, is increasingly demonstrating its importance in the digitization and intelligent research of ancient texts. However, cultivating interdisciplinary talents proficient in both classical literature and technology is extremely challenging.

As a textbook born in the era of artificial intelligence and aimed at liberal arts students, this book has the following five main features:

#### 1. Breaking the long-standing bias that "liberal arts students are insulated from technology", enabling the mastery of programming skills within the context of literature.

This book, with its unique perspective and humorous language, shatters the "stereotype" that learning databases equates to monotonously memorizing SQL syntax. By guiding readers through objectives such as deciphering character frequencies and poetic rhythms in the *Complete Tang Poems* or tracking historical trajectories of figures, the learning of programming skills is not confined to mastering new technologies. Instead, it emphasizes inspiring humanities readers to gain new insights and deeper understanding of ancient texts.

#### 2. Innovatively integrating classical literature with modern technology.

This book does not merely teach programming techniques but guides readers to re-examine classics through a technological lens. When readers use SQL statements to analyze Li Bai's poetry or visualize Du Fu's life trajectory with JavaScript, they will discover the digital charm embedded within. It turns out that digital technology can so elegantly and systematically reveal the beauty of literature. This cross-disciplinary thinking will promote multi-disciplinary integration and create more possibilities for the digital era.

#### 3. A "learning by doing" practical teaching model that makes education enjoyable.

This book adopts a "learning by doing" practical teaching model, with each chapter equipped with rich hands-on projects and theoretical explanations. From basic database operations to complex web crawling techniques and advanced data visualization applications, readers can practice what they learn while building their own digital humanities projects.

#### 4. Focusing on the application of cutting-edge technologies in the humanities.

This book delves into how to use databases and web technologies to construct ancient text retrieval systems and how to restore geographical scenes in classical literary works through geographic information systems. These applications of cutting-edge technologies not only provide more convenient and efficient tools for academic research but also significantly enhance learners' competitiveness.

#### 5. Upholding principles of richness, openness, and extensibility, advocating for divergent thinking.

This book includes a "Thinking and Practice" section at the end of each chapter, encouraging readers to apply what they have learned to their areas of interest. Whether readers are passionate about classical poetry or fascinated by modern literature, they can find suitable project directions in this book. This flexible and diverse learning approach ensures that education is not confined to textbooks and classrooms but becomes a fun and challenging journey of self-exploration.

*Digital Humanities in Practice* focuses on "learning for application" rather than mere theoretical discussion. Every concept and every line of code is closely connected to practical applications. In this data-driven era, mastering these skills not only inspires readers to explore classical literature from new perspectives but also cultivates their practical abilities and innovative thinking in the technological field.

## Textbook Applications

### Digital Humanities Lecture Series: Database Programming Applications

From January 13 to 22, 2024, the Language Big Data and Computational Humanities Research Center at Nanjing Normal University's School of Liberal Arts hosted the first "Digital Humanities Lecture Series: Database Programming Applications." This winter school, based on the course application, offered 32 class hours of digital humanities and database programming instruction. It featured lectures by three renowned scholars on *The Construction and Application of the Xunzi Large Model*, *The Construction and Application of the Chinese Ethnic Language Knowledge Base*, and *Corpus-Based Collocation Research and English Academic Writing*, broadening participants' horizons. Nearly 100 faculty and students from 43 domestic and international institutions, including Waseda University, Dankook University, the University of Macau, Peking University, Zhejiang University, and Fudan University, participated in the program and completed approximately 60 humanities databases.

After the course, participants expressed significant gains and hoped for its continuation with accompanying textbooks. By this time, the textbook was mostly complete, and during a visiting research fellowship at the University of Macau from April to August 2024, it could be finalized. Collaborating with Professor Yuan Yulin's team at the University of Macau, it became evident that this course had substantial demand within the university's Faculty of Arts and Humanities. With two other computational linguists also visiting, plans for a summer school began, receiving strong support from Dean Xu Jie, a Changjiang Scholar, and Professor Yuan Yulin, head of the Department of Chinese Language and Literature. Additionally, Deputy Library Director Liang Dehai provided valuable archival data as course materials.

### University of Macau-Nanjing Normal University Summer Institute on Corpus and Digital Humanities

From August 10 to 18, 2024, **the Language Big Data and Computational Humanities Research Center** at Nanjing Normal University's School of Liberal Arts and the Faculty of Arts and Humanities at the University of Macau jointly hosted the **"University of Macau-Nanjing Normal University Summer Institute on Corpus and Digital Humanities."**

<img title="" src="imgs/poster.png" alt="pic1.png" data-align="center" >

Through a combination of online and offline sessions totaling 32 class hours, the institute taught knowledge and techniques in corpus linguistics and digital humanities. Seven renowned scholars were specially invited to deliver lectures, broadening students' academic horizons. The summer institute attracted 956 faculty and students from 371 institutions across 20 countries and regions worldwide. Ultimately, 110 participants (both online and offline) were admitted to the 8-day program, successfully completing over 90 database systems.
